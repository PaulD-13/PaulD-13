### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Paul and I am currently working on a Web Development course, this is my first time using GitHub

My profile is a work in progress

I just learnt how to add and resize a picture

**PaulD-13/PaulD-13** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various web based projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about football (soccer)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've visited over 35 US states
